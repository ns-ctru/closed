A handful of models could not be tested because the Estimation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm could not compute a fit.  The specific error (reported by Stata 14.1) was `cannot compute an improvement -- discontinuous region encountered` which means it can not improve the Maximum Likelihood of the model.  This occurred with the most basic model (one case-site with a single step).  Further investigation as suggested \href{http://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1312718-xtnbreg-error}{here} did not provide any insight or result in the models running.
