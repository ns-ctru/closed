#### Missing Data   {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

A summary of the pattern of missing data for each of the outcomes is provided at both the Site (ED) level and at the LSOA level (within each site).

```{r missing_review, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'asis', eval = TRUE}
kable(check.site.reviewers,
      caption = 'Summary of missing data by measure/sub-measure/town for EDs')
```

```{r missing_site, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'asis', eval = FALSE}
kable(check.site,
      caption = 'EDs with missing data for all outcomes.')

```

```{r missing_lsoa, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'asis', eval = FALSE}
kable(check.lsoa,
      caption = 'EDs with missing data for all outcomes. The LSOAs column indicates the number of LSOAs within the denoted site with missing data for the stated relative month.')

```
