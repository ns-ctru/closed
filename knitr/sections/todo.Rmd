### Methods

* Ideally get markdown/R syntax highlighting working in Emacs, this will ease the working environment as code will be simpler to read and layout.

#### Heteroskedasticity

* Currently the SAP which lifts text from previous NHS 111 study states that heteroskedasticity will be dealt with by re-analysing indicators with significant outcomes using the square-root of the observed values.  This may be valid but the analysis routines provide different options for explicitly dealing with such heteroskedasticity internally when performing the analysis, including using a Huber-White style sandwich estimator, panel-corrected standard errors that are robust to heterosedasticity and contemperaneous correlation across panels, panel weighted least squares to deal with panel heteroskedasticity and Parks-Kmenta FGLS to estimate both panel heteroskedasticity and correlation (see the [panelCorrMethod option at the bottom of pg5](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/panelAR/panelAR.pdf)).  This may well negate the need to replicate analyses using the square root of the measures.


#### Data

* Analyse all the other indicators.  More outcomes now complete thanks to data provision from Tony a few more still to go.
* ~~Not quite captured correct range for pooled analyses, need to correct.~~ Tony now aligns centers in data preparation.
* ~~Incorporate all additional steps.  Have most but not all, awaiting remainder from Emma.~~ Emma provided steps and these are now incorporated into analyses.

#### Analyses

* Revisit cross-valildation and investigate why there is disparity between Stata and R (e.g. Model 3 - Hemel Hempstead and Closure interactions, the signs flip).  Suggested it might be down to missing data/coding, but this has been checked and they are the same underlying data being analysed in both models.  Stata consistently has smaller Standard Errors too, likely down to choice of method for dealing with heteroskedasticity and correlation.
* ~~Ensure panels are balanced.~~ Done for models within a case sites group, getting covariance errors when attempting to balance in pooled analyses (models 4, 5 and 7), working on this.
* ~~Explicitly define the reference groups for sites so that coefficients (including those for interaction terms) reflect the change at the intervention site (currently done alphabetically).~~
* ~~Cross-validation results from panelAR function against those from Stata (** Awaiting Stata Technical Support **)~~ Cross-validation complete, but there are a small number of models where some of the coefficients don't match (see above).
* ~~Check Cases v's all Controls (Unmatched) filtering is correct.~~


### Presentation

#### Figures

* From Jon via Tony - ** I think it's on your to-do list: Can you plot the measures for the control sites separately but as per the plotting you've done for the intervention sites (this, I think, is for Jon to "eyeball" the underlying data to check there's nothing strange going on).** Need clarification as controls are already plotted.
* Tweak lines on matched graphs to distinguish cases from control sites (line pattern?).
* Add vertical lines for additional steps (possibly tricky given facetting being used, could make graphs look messy).


#### Tables

* What else should be summarised?  I didn't think summaries of events by LSOA was useful nor appropriate as this is time series.  Could tabulate whats in the figures but that again seems somewhat redundant.  Similarly I could have produced summaries of the population sizes, but these are counted on a monthly basis so it would be quite a large table, most of which would expect to be of little to no interest, and it could be presented more clearly in a figure if required.

#### Layout

* ~~Derive a sensible and clean tabulated layout for the results, not sure this current layout is sufficiently intuitive.~~ Tabbed layout facilitates viewing a large number of outcomes in a consistent manner.  Forest plots and tables of only coefficients of interest simplifies this too.
