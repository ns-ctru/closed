## Site Summary

```{r summary, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'asis', eval = TRUE}
load('d:/Rpackages/rclosed/data/unnecessary ed attendances measure.Rda')
time.to.ed <- closed_summary(df          = unnecessary_ed_attendances_measure,
                             df.steps    = sites,
                             vars        = value,
                             digits      = 3,
                             latex       = FALSE,
                             html        = FALSE)
kable(time.to.ed$formatted)

```

**TODO** What else should be summarised?  I didn't think summaries of events by LSOA was useful nor appropriate as this is time series.  Could tabulate whats in the figures but that again seems somewhat redundant.  Similarly I could have produced summaries of the population sized, but these are counted on a monthly basis so it would be quite a large table, most of which would be of little to no interest, and it could be presented more clearly in a figure if required.  The variation in population size will eventually be taken account of when standardising rates.
