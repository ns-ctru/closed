#### Data Description

A short summary of the variables that are used within the dataset, as much for the statisticians reference than anyones use.  Each data file comes in two formats, one at the LSOA level and one at the ED level and the filenames follow a consistent nomenclature which consists of `[DESCRIPTION] - [lsoa|site] - YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm.Rda` where `DESCRIPTION` varies between files, `[lsoa|site]` indicates the level of the data and `YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm` is a date/time stamp in [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

#### Difference in Time to Emergency Department

The difference in time to emergency department from the centroid of Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) is summarised for each site in the table below.  For sites where an Emergency Department (ED) closed there are two summaries, one when the ED was open and another summarising travel times after they had closed.

```{r summary_time_to_ed, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'asis', eval = TRUE}
kable(diff.time.to.ed$formatted)
diff.time.to.ed$plot.time.to.ed
