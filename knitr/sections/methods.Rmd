## Model specification

There are two packages for [R](https://www.r-projects.org/) that implement the Prais-Winsten method of adjusting for auto-correlation in time-series analyses, [panelAR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/panelAR/index.html) or [prais](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prais/index.html).  The intention is to use both to cross-validate the results against each other, however at present time has only permitted one (panelAR) to be implemented.

Currently panel-corrected standard errors are used which are robust to heteroskedaasticity and contemporaneous correlation across panels, but other options are available, such as a Huber-White style sandwich estimateor for panel heteroskedasticity, panel weighted least squares procedure for heteroskedasticity or Parks-Kmenta FGLS to estimate both heteroskedasticity and correlation.
